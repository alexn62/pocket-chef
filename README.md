### Pocket Chef - A Smart Recipe Manager built with Flutter



This app is a continuation of my previously released app called 'Pizza Calc'.

While Pizza Calc allows users to calculate the correct amount of ingredients to get a perfect pizza dough every time, this app brings things to the next level.

In this app, I adopted some of the UI from Pizza Calc, but added more  functionalities. The most important of which is the ability to add your own recipes to the app. 
The recipes are stored in a secure database and are ready to be read, updated, and deleted as you wish.

By entering the amount of ingredients needed for one serving size, the app will do the calculations in the background to figure out how those amounts change depending on the user's desired number of servings and serving sizes.

(Currently being reviewed by Google Playstore before deployment)
